# gotest

## Installation

### Source

#### Install via `go get`

To build `gotest` from source, first install the [Go
toolchain](https://golang.org/dl/). You can then install the latest `gotest` from
Github using:

```console
$ go get -u github.com/AndriyKalashnykov/gotest
```

⚠️ Make sure `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `PATH` to use the version installed from
source.

If you've made local modifications to the repository at
`$GOPATH/src/github.com/vmware/govmomi`, you can install using:

```console
$ go install github.com/AndriyKalashnykov/gotest
```
